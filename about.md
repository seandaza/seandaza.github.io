<span style ="color:red">Tell me About Yourself</span>

I chose to study computer science and programming becauseI understand that technology can positively help society, understand complex business processes and optimize time.

I recently learned how to do web programming with React and node.js and made my own netflix app clone with these frameworks.

I want to further develop those skills, those IT skills by working with important companies to understand how to make them more valuables


<span style ="color:red">Any conflict with co-worker?</span>

Last year I had a group project with three other people and I wanna take on a part of the project that I felt I could handle well, but one of my colleagues also wanted that part of the project.So, my first initiative was to negotiate and work together with him.we both learned from that experience.


<span style ="color:red">Why did you leave your previous job?</span>

I feel that I grew professionally what I needed and that I wanted to focus on the technological area and I am ready to take on new responsibilities and take on more of a leader in a project.


<span style ="color:red">Why should we hire you?</span>

I have noticed based on my research on linkedIn that successful employees are curious people that never stop learning, and I consider that I am one of them.


<span style ="color:red">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</span>

So, first, i want to handle all the technical aspects of data analytics of the project right now in the role i applying for. But in 5 years, i see myself leading those projects. So handling a team, maybe do a little bit of project management, and be involved in the sales process. I would love to pitch our services to prospective clients and help them through the project along the line.


<span style ="color:red">Any Weakness?</span>

In one of my lasts jobs, i used to say yes to everything i was asked for. I guess I thought i just wanted to become more valuable, but i ended up turning some projects late by one week because i had too much in my plate. I learned to be more realistic in my deadlines and in my workload, saying yes only to what i knew i could do within the deadline,but also suggesting great colleagues and resources to help me in tasks i knew i couldn't do alone.
